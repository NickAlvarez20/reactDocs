## Project Name
React + Vite Quick Start

## About
This is a minimal **React** application bootstrapped with **Vite** — the fast, modern frontend build tool.  

It serves as my personal playground for working through React's official Quick Start documentation, trying out core concepts (components, props, state, hooks, JSX, etc.), and experimenting with Vite's excellent developer experience (instant HMR, fast builds, etc.).

The project uses the default Vite template with some ESLint rules pre-configured and notes about optional plugins/tools like React Compiler and SWC.

Ideal for:  
- Following along with React docs  
- Practicing modern React setup  
- Learning Vite as an alternative to Create React App

## Prerequisites
To run this project you need:

- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended) and **npm** (or **yarn** / **pnpm**) installed on your system.

No additional global libraries are required — everything is managed via npm.

## Features
This React + Vite starter includes these key features:
- Lightning-fast development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- React Fast Refresh support via official Vite plugins
- Modern ESLint configuration for code quality
- Support for CSS / PostCSS / modules out of the box
- Minimal production-ready build (tiny bundle size)
- Easy extensibility (add TypeScript, Tailwind, React Router, etc.)

## Getting Started & Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/reactDocs.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd reactDocs
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  # or
  yarn install
  # or
  pnpm install


## Usage
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev

2. Open http://localhost:5173 (or the port shown in terminal) in your browser.
3. To build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
4. Preview the production build:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:
* Understand how to set up a modern React project without Create React App
* Get comfortable with Vite's super-fast dev server and build performance
* Explore React basics through official documentation while having live reload
* Learn about optional enhancements (React Compiler, SWC instead of Babel, TypeScript integration)
* Practice extending a frontend starter template with new libraries/tools
## Contributing
This is primarily a personal learning / portfolio repository, so formal contributions aren’t required. However, if you spot bugs, want to add examples from React docs (components, hooks demos, etc.), or suggest improvements, feel free to:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (git checkout -b feature/add-hooks-demo)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add useEffect example component')
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/add-hooks-demo)
5. Open a Pull Request

Please include clear explanations and keep the minimal spirit of the project.
